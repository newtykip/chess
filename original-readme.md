# chess

A bit of an ambitious second project, I know. But I feel like I could learn quite a lot from making
a game as sophisticated as Chess in an engine like Unity without a lot of C# knowledge. This is just
going to be one big learning experience for me (:

Hopefully it goes well, I'll make a proper readme for this project later on <3
